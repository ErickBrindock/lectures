1.  If I have a set of initial values `x0, z0, v0`, how do I initialize a 2-D array `y` where each column of `y` will represent `x`, `z`, and `v`.

2. What is the energy of an anharmonic oscillator, which obeys the following ODE:

$$
\frac{d^2 x}{dt^2} = - \frac{k}{m} x^d
$$
and has initial conditions `(x[0], v[0]) = (x_0, 0)`.

[My apologies, by the way, for the terrible notation in the homework that overloads $m$ to refer to both mass and the order of the position in the spring restoring force.]

Recall that energy of a simple dynamical system, $E$, is the sum of the potential, $E_{\rm P.E.}$, and kinetic energy, $E_{\rm K.E.}$:
$$
E = E_{\rm P.E.} + E_{\rm K.E.}
$$
where the change in potential energy is the negative of the work done.
$$
E_{\rm P.E.} = - \int_0^x F dx 
$$
