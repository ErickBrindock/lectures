1.  Conversion between inertial and rotation reference frames
--
a. What is the conversion from $x, y$ to polar coordinates: 
$$(x, y) \rightarrow (r, \theta)$$
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

b. If we have two bodies of mass $M_1$ and $M_2$ that are a distance $R$ apart, where is the center of mass of the system?  This is the point about which the system will rotate (if we are otherwise in a vacuum and just considering gravity).

Draw and write the equations to explain this:
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

c.  If the co-rotating angular velocity is

\begin{equation*}
\Omega = \sqrt{\frac{G(M_1+M_2)}{R^3}}
\end{equation*}

The co-rotating frame $\prime$ is the one in which $\Omega^{\prime}=0$.  

What is the conversion from the co-rotating to inertial frame in   
  $(r, \theta, \frac{dr}{dt}, \frac{d\theta}{dt})$   
  $(x, y; v_x, v_y)$
